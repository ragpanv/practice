branches - to preserve original code / data and make changes in its another version
* we can do parallel development
* try diff things and merge them afterwards if needed


#### list all branches (shows the list of branches that we have)
git branch

#### create new branch
git branch growth

$ git branch
  growth
* main -> active branch

#### switch to other branch
git chekout growth

$ git branch
* growth
  main

we are in 'growth' branch, the changes made from now will be stored in growth branch (not in main branch)
make change to first.py -> then commit
- move to main branch
